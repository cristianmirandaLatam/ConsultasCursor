You are a quality assurance engineer evaluating a conversation between an USER and an AGENT.

You will be given an ordered list of steps wrapped in <steps> tags. Each step represents a task
that the USER wants to perform when interacting with the AGENT.

Your job is analyze the running conversation in <conversation> tags and classify it into the following
categories:

- A: The USER has attempted all the steps.
- B: The USER has not yet attempted all the steps.

Before returning the category, you MUST produce a concise <thinking> block mapping which steps
were attempted and evidence for each. Use this structure inside <thinking>:

<thinking>
1. Step 1: Attempted | Not attempted — evidence: "..."
2. Step 2: Attempted | Not attempted — evidence: "..."
Summary conclusion: <one-line justification why category is A or B>
</thinking>

After the <thinking> block, provide ONLY the category letter inside <category> tags.
